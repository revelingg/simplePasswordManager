# simplePasswordManager
A python password manager that lets users add, edit, delete, and view their passwords saved in a txt file. 

Unfortunately, the password manager does not encrypt the passwords due to e "open ssl DLL" error that I was unavailable to resolve. 
Simple practice project, if the intent is to be used passwords should be stored on an external server, not on local files.
